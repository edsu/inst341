What is "curation"?

## Description

Explores various dimensions and contexts for digital curation, which includes
all activities involving the management, representation and preservation of both
born-digital and digitized information. Focuses on opportunities, challenges and
demands of every-increasing digital data and networked information
infrastructure.

## Learning Objectives

### Adam's:

* Develop a broad appreciation of digital curation and how different cultural
  institutions implement its principles in varying ways.
* Become familiar with the metadata standards and technologies that provide the
  foundation for digital curation systems.
* Acquire experience using software used in libraries, archives, and museums
  for digital curation activities.
* Improve communication skills through writing and presentation of course
  projects.

### Katrina's

* Identify key models, strategies, and standards for digital curation
* Define the principle challenges, strategies, and implications of each phase
  of a data lifecycle, including creation/acquisition, selection/appraisal,
  ingest, preservation, storage, access and use, and transformation
* Articulate an understanding of key concepts of and approaches to digital
  preservation
* Create a data curation profile and plan for the stewardship of digital assets
  and collections
* Identify and assess the data needs of user groups and repositories

### Ricky's 

The course will provide you with essential knowledge for pursing a variety of
career paths, including:

* Professional careers in archives and records management-This course provides you an introduction to the field; introduces terms and concepts that will be used in more advanced courses; and builds a foundation for internships and professional networking.
* Careers in related information fields-This course provides you with a survey of broadly applicable concepts used in information management, data curation, information policy, and user services.
* Advanced degrees in history-This course provides you with critical understanding of how archives are formed and organized; describes how archival actions, policies and functions influence knowledge production; and gives an overview of the changing intellectual and social perspectives on the function archives in society as well as the purpose and value of archival research.

### Ed's:

* theory
* practice
* politics

We could spend the semester looking at a dataset and how it has been developed. Or we could spend the semester learning how to build our own dataset. Or we could do both. Perhaps we could spend 70% of the time learning about a set of datasets, and then altering it in some way? Data is always found.

Get comfortable with the command line where things can be easily automated. Get
acquainted with the filesystem, since it is the primary.
