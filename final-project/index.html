<h1 id="final-project">Final Project</h1>
<p>The final project is similar to our weekly writing and notebook exercises but it is self-directed on a topic of your choosing. The goal is for you to demonstrate some of what you’ve learned over the semester in the context of a topic we haven’t yet talked about.</p>
<p>Please choose option A or B. If you’d like to make sure your topic is OK, or would like to propose an alternative project please send me an email at edsu@umd.edu.</p>
<h2 id="a.-essay">A. Essay</h2>
<p>Examine aspects of digital curation such as file formats, standards, metadata, platforms, community or infrastructure as they relate to a particular subject You can choose your own subject but here are some ideas to get you thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>a data standard: e.g. PDF/A, Zip, Matroska</li>
<li>a specific dataset: e.g. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-covid-19-deaths-counts-by-age-in-years-2db45</li>
<li>a data data service: e.g. data.gov, kaggle.com</li>
<li>a web platform: e.g. YouTube</li>
<li>a curation community: e.g. Wikipedia, GlobalVoices, Bellingcat</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The essay should be a minimum of 500 words</li>
<li>Please submit the essay as a PDF, Word document or text file</li>
<li>Cite any sources that you use in a bibliography</li>
<li><em>Optional:</em> publish your essay in a blog post on medium.com, wordpress.com or somewhere else.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b.-notebook">B. Notebook</h2>
<p>Examine aspects of digital curation such as the use of file formats, standards, metadata, platforms, community or infrastructure as they relate to a particular set of processing steps in a Jupyter notebook. Use the notebook to demonstrate your understanding of how some of the concepts we’ve learned about apply to a particular digital curation task. Some examples could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the metadata in a collection of mp3 files, or jpeg files.</li>
<li>Calculate the total size of files in a dataset you found.</li>
<li>Extract data that has been put into a Web platform.</li>

</ul>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Python Jupyter Notebook: submit a .ipynb file</li>
<li>Include any data used with a URL or an uploaded zip file, or Google Drive share..</li>
<li>You can use any tools we’ve used over the semester (e.g. python-magic, youtube_dl, etc) or new ones as long as you explain how to install them.</li>
<li>Your code should be executable and not generate errors.</li>
<li>Your code should include documentation (text cells) that explain what is happening in the notebook and why.</li>
</ul>
