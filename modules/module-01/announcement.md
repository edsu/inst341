Welcome to Introduction to Digital Curation!

I'm really looking forward to exploring the theory and practice of digital
curation with you you this semester.

On Monday of each week I will send you an announcement like this about what we
will be doing that week. Our class will be asynchronous, which means you are not
required to attend live lectures or discussion. However I will have live
optional office hours every Thursday from 2-4pm on Zoom if you would like to be
part of a live discussion.

For this week I'd like you to take a look at the Module 1 Overview page and
follow the instructions you find there.

Please feel free to reach out to me in ELMS with any questions you might have at
this stage.
