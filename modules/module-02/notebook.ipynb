    "As we learned in Chapter 2 of [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) the *file* and *file formats* are foundational concepts for digital curation, and for computing in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "> File formats enable most modern computing. A file format is a convention that established the rules of how information is structured and stored in a file. File extensions (.mp3, .jpg, .doc), in part, define the file and enable it to be interpreted. (p. 47)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be taking a closer look at some of these formats in the coming weeks. But first we are going to review some of what you learned in Introduction to Programming about how to interact with files and [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system). While there are many types of file systems with different properties many of them offer the same Application Programming Interface or [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) which allows you to interact with files using read and write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital curation practices often involve interacting with the file system in order to read, write and update files. Most computer operating systems (Windows, OS X, etc) provide access to the file system using applications like the File Explorer (Windows) and the Finder (OS X). Digital curation regularly requires *documenting* and performing *repeatable* interactions with files and the file system. Programming languages like Python are useful for automating digital curation tasks and workflows, and for documenting the curatorial behaviors. Being able to create and modify these programs is a useful digital curation skill.\n",

    "This notebook provides some examples of reading from and writing to the filesystem and then asks you to perform a similar task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module provides an object-oriented way to interact with the filesystem. It is named *pathlib* because it is organized around the idea of *file paths* which are locations for files on the file system. Normally you see these using a notation something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    /home/ed/documents/resume.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "or on Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    C:\\Users\\Ed\\Documents\\resume.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "The two different notations are expressing the same thing, a location for a file on the file system by starting at the *root* of the file system and then navigating down through *folders* (also known as *directories*) until there is a name for a *file*. This is known as an *absolute path* because it is anchored to the root of the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example we can crate a path for the computer's root file system:"

We'll be discussing some of these operations in future modules. For now we are going to focus on reading the files in a directory and figuring out how much data they contain as an example\n",

We will be talking about cloud services like Google Drive and container formats like ZIP in the coming weeks. So for now just run these notebook cells even if you don't understand them just yet."
