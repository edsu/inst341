    "# File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Files and file formats are a very important idea for digital curation because they are the primary abstraction we use to talk about data. If you open up your File Explorer on your computer you can see your operating system and applications are all made up of files. Our so called \"smart\" phones are often dumbed down to prevent us from seeing the files that are there. Even on the web where data feels like it is \"in the cloud\" there are files on someone else's computer that we call a server or perhaps thousands of servers that make files available over the network as bit streams. Bit streams is another name for a file, a discrete sequence of binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as we read about in Chapter 3 of The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation, these files, or bit streams, have something in common: they all have a particular *format*. These formats define the shape of the data, and often have *standards* associated with how the files of a particular format should be put together. Having standard file formats allows us to reliably *render* the files in particular ways. For example the MP4 file format can be rendered by a video player like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and also your web browser. Agreement about how an MP4 should be structured is what allows multiple applications to open an MP4 file, play it, pause it, adjust its volume, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore two ways of discovering what format a file is in, and how to determine what application can be used to render it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the Module 2 Notebook assignment many files have a file extension, which gives us a hint about what format the data is in. This is typically a short sequence of characters following a period in the filename. File extensions are a naming convention that may or may not correctly identify the format that the file is in. For example the filename:\n",
    "\n",
    "    paper.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "has the file extension `pdf` which is an acronym for the [Portable Document Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) that was created by Adobe Corporation in 1993 and was standardized as [ISO 32000](https://www.iso.org/standard/51502.html) in 2008. But if you wanted you could rename a `file.mp4` to a `file.pdf`. That woudln't change the format of the file itself, just its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take another look at some of the file extensions. We will start by downloading the files we used in Module 2. that are part of the [Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org/) dataset."

    "> The JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) is a file format for storing JPEG-compressed raster images. It was developed by the Independent JPEG Group and C-Cube Microsystems, in the absence of any such format being defined in the JPEG standard, and rapidly became a de facto standard. A JFIF file comprises a JPEG data stream together with a JFIF marker. It begins with a Start of Image (SOI) marker, immediately followed by a JFIF Application (APP0) marker and one or more optional application extension markers. This is followed by the JPEG image data, which is terminated by an End of Image (EOI) marker. JFIF supports up to 24-bit colour and uses lossy compression (based on the Discrete Cosine Transform algorithm). Other types of compression are available through JPEG extensions, including progressive image buildup, arithmetic encoding, variable quantization, selective refinement, image tiling, and lossless compression, but these may not be supported by all JFIF readers and writers."
