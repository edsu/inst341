## Learning Outcomes:

* Snowden, E. (2019). Permanent Record, Chapter 16 Tokyo.
* Owens, T. (2018). The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation. Chapter 6 Managing Copies and Formats.

## Discussion:

* Why do you think the sustainability of file formats important for digital curation?
* What seven factors does Owens think should be used to evaluate the sustainability of a file format?
