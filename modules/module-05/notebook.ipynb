    "# External Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned about in our reading of [The Numbers Don't Speak for Themselves](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/2) in [Data Faminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) this week, the description of data is extremely important, particularly when it comes to understanding the context which data was generated. We also learned in Owens, Chapter 6 that as a practical matter part of this context includes recording what a file looks like at a particular point in time, or its *fixity*. Knowing what files should be present, and what content they contain is a fundamental requirement when caring for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixity\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular way of managing fixity information for files is to create what's called a digital fingerprint or *hash* for a file. As Owens says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that takes a given set of data (like a file) and computes a sequence of characters that then serves as a fingerprint for that data. Even changing a single bit in a file will result in a totally different sequence of characters. For example, I computed an MD5 hash for an image file and return the value \"4937A316849E472473608D43446EBF9EF\". Now if I compute the has for another copy of that file and get the same result, I'll have rather high confidence that those two copies are exactly the same. Similarly, if I have a stored value from the last time I computed a hash for that file, when I recompute the hash in the futre and get that value again, I have a high degreee of confidence that the file has not been chnanged or altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manifests\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not uncommon to store a list of files and their fixity values in a file called a *manifest*. The idea of a manifest is not unique to digital curation, and comes from an [older transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_(transportation). When shipping things long distances it's often important to make sure what was put on the ship didn't dissappear en route.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/manifest.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept that is used to track things as they move through space can be applied to things as they travel in time. A manifest simply lists the things we expect to be present, and what their state should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Fixity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will experiment with generating fixity values, and storing them in a machine reaadable manifest. We will also check the manifest to make sure the files look ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "First lets install some data to work with."
