# Community

## Learning outcomes:

* Evaluate the modes of participation in online communities.

## Readings:

* Wilkinson, M. (2016). The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and
  stewardship. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160018.
* [The FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office. 

## Discussion:

* In your own words what are the components of the FAIR principles?
* Identify one of the FAIR principles at work (either positively or negatively) in a digital curation project. For example you could choose to look at how a particular dataset on data.gov or Kaggle was released. Or you could look at a project like HathiTrust Research Center or Wikipedia Downloads. Or you could look at he community guidelines for a platform like Instagram or Twitter. Please feel to use the same subject as your final project if you like.

## Exercises:

* Examine DMCA take down notices in the Lumen Database. Think about both how it is made available as a dataset, and documents curation practices in a service like YouTube.
