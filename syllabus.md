# INST341 - Introduction to Digital Curation

**Instructor:** Ed Summers  edsu@umd.edu
**Office Hours:** Thursday 2-4 and Friday 2-4 on [Zoom](https://umd.zoom.us/my/esummers)

## Catalog Description

Explores various dimensions and contexts for digital curation, which includes
all activities involving the management, representation and preservation of both
born-digital and digitized information. Focuses on opportunities, challenges and
demands of every-increasing digital data and networked information
infrastructure.

## Course Description

Our daily lives are suffused with flows of data. From the apps on our phones, to
the web platforms we use, to the devices that track our movements in the world
and the algorithms that analyze and classify us. What does this data look like?
How is it collected and described? Who can access it? How is it persisted,
preserved, and purged. How can we resist it? In this class we will explore these
questions using the theories and practices of *digital curation* or the care of 
data. By the end of the semester you will be able to analyze and document these
data flows using principles drawn from archival studies. We will learn the
practice of digital curation by using open source technologies and the Python
programming language. 

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Recognize digital curation concepts in your daily lives and future careers.
2. Use the Python programming language to perform digital curation tasks.
3. Critically examine the social and political aspects of digital curation.

## Technology Requirements

## Reading Materials

All readings will be posted to ELMS as PDFs. We will be reading selections from
the following texts, which you may optionally purchase copies if you still
like books (I do!).

Owens, T. (2018). The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation. Johns Hopkins
University Press.

Lampland, M. and Star, S. L. (2009). Standards and their stories: How quantifying, classifying, and formalizing practices shape everyday life. Cornell University Press.

## Modules

The semester is designed to help you build competency with digital curation
concepts while applying them in actual digital curation exercises. These modules
build on foundational concepts of computation that you learned in INST126 as
well as theories about the organization of information in INST201 and INST311.
In addition to gaining fluency with digital curation practice at the end of the
semester you will have designed and developed your own digital curation project
that you can add to your portfolio of work.
