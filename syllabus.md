# INST341 - Introduction to Digital Curation

**Instructor:** Ed Summers  edsu@umd.edu
**Office Hours:** Thursday 2-4 and Friday 2-4 on [Zoom](https://umd.zoom.us/my/esummers)

## Catalog Description

Explores various dimensions and contexts for digital curation, which includes
all activities involving the management, representation and preservation of both
born-digital and digitized information. Focuses on opportunities, challenges and
demands of every-increasing digital data and networked information
infrastructure.

## Course Description

Our daily lives are suffused with flows of data. From the apps on our phones, to
the web platforms we use, to the devices that track our movements in the world
and the algorithms that analyze and classify us. What does this data look like?
How is it collected and described? Who can access it? How is it persisted,
preserved, and purged. How can we resist it? In this class we will explore these
questions using the theories and practices of *digital curation*. By the end
of the semester you will be able to analyze and document these data flows using
principles drawn from archival studies. We will learn the practice of digital
curation by using open source technologies and the Python programming language.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Recognize digital curation in your daily life and future career.
2. Use the Python programming language to perform digital curation tasks.
3. Critically examine the social and political aspects of digital curation.

## Technology Requirements

To complete the exercises in this class you will need a computer to access
the Jupyter notebook envrionment at colab.research.google.com. If you 
prefer you can use a Jupyter notebook environment on your own computer. But
it will be your responsibility to ensure you are running the correct version
of Jupyter and are able to install third party Python modules like we will be
doing in colab.

## Reading Materials

All readings will be posted to ELMS as PDFs. We will be reading selections from
a few books which will be available in full as PDFs. If you prefer to sometimes 
read books (I do!) you can puchase hard copies of them at your favorite book seller.

* Owens, T. (2018). The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation. Johns Hopkins
University Press.
* D’Ignazio, C. and Klein, L. F. (2020). [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/). MIT Press.

## Modules

The semester is designed to help you build competency with digital curation
concepts while applying them in actual digital curation exercises. These modules
build on foundational concepts of computation that you learned in INST126 as
well as theories about the organization of information in INST201 and INST311.
In addition to gaining fluency with digital curation practice at the end of the
semester you will have designed and developed your own digital curation project
that you can add to your portfolio of work.
